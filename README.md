# EVAbase: a personal collections database
I need a database to catalog and track my collection of fossils, minerals, and rocks. This SQLite database has two linked tables to hold accession and specimen data; eventually, I plan to include linked locality and agent date tables as extensions. 

Explanation of Contents:
EVAbase_2022-1.txt      SQL code for cataloging specimens from 2022 (a backlog still exists).
EVAbase_2021-1.txt      SQL code to create accessions and specimen catalog tables, catalog specimens from 2021 (a backlog still exists).
EvaBASE.db              SQLite database with accessions and specimen catalog tables.
